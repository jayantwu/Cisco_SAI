DDR3 eTrain Updates for Build IDs 0x0062 and 0x0063
- Changed default ddr3_phy_t_rdlat_offset parameter from 7 to 6 for 1866 presets
- Added dual-frequency write-leveling algorithm.  This is the new default for 1866 and 2133 presets.
- Added additional user parameters

    0x1e ddr3_dual_freq_write_levling_enable (default=1)
         Forces Dual Frequency Write Leveling on or off.  This parameter is
         auto configured when interrupt 0x39, ddr3_set_frequency_config, is
         run.  It can be overwritten by the user after issuing interrupt 0x39.

    0x1f ddr3_fine_read_gate_training_enable (default=1)
         When set to 1, both coarse and fine read-gate training are performed.
         When set to 0, only coarse read-gate training is performed.

- Changed ddr3_max_timeout default from 100 to 1000
- Added checks to ensure proper exiting of write-leveling, read-gate training and PBDS after an error condition
- Added new DDR3 eTrain error codes

    110 ERROR_TRAINING_ALREADY_ACTIVE
        Indicates training can't be started because it is already running.
        This may be due to a previous training failure and training must be
        forced to end using interrupt 0x3D - ddr3_force_training_complete.

    504 ERROR_EXIT_WRITE_LEVEL_TRAINING_TIMEOUT
        Write level training did not terminate properly while exiting training.

    505 ERROR_EXIT_READ_GATE_TRAINING_TIMEOUT
        Read gate training did not terminate properly while exiting training.

    506 ERROR_EXIT_PBDS_TRAINING_TIMEOUT
        PBDS training did not terminate properly while exiting training.

- Optimized coarse read-gate training to account for analog behavior of results
- Adjusted read-gate training to provide more optimal fine-gate code.  These should now range between 0x4 and 0xb.
- Improved PBDS algorithm

# 1090	Release Notes
1	Added iCal effort 0x10 that provides better performance than effort 0 and still meet IEEE / FC link training time
2	Fixed an issue causing RXFFE BFHF to get reset to 0 overriding user programmed value
3	Added feature to use firmware filtered EID and option to oscillate signal_ok while signal is present
4	Fixes issue that caused fixed LF to be set forever if DVOS/vernier delta cal failed
5	Fixes frequency lock issue if Tx is enabled after Rx
6	Fixed infinite loop in rare case causing CDR failing to lock to 
7	Added feature to adapt remote TX cursor during link training
8	Added user configurable parameter to avoid over-emphesis out of iCal tune for NRZ mode with short channel and no TX attenuation
9	To avoid potential burst changed pCal to only move one parameter at a time and option to move two parameters at a time
10	Added option to extend TX Post range removing TX Pre2

Avago Serdes 0x109b Release Notes	

0x109B_208D: (Released ~March 2019)
1	Added support for link training to request pre-code from remote TX.
	PAM4 with precoding modulation can be enabled using: 
	Int 0x3D, Data 0x2400
2	Fix the issue causing Link Training timeout timer in 64G FC mode to be 
	modified by firmware when link training is repeated
3	Update to maintain unused DVOS in NRZ mode at 0
4	Fix to support low impedence mode using the documented control, int 0x2B
5	Addressed issue that cause CDR to not lock
6	Ignore TC=1 flag during FC ASN
7	Fix the issue causing long time to disable receiver if pCal was enabled

0x109B_208D_003 	
-	lowers delta_cal_fail threshold from 10 to 4. 
-	Fix for precoding bug in PMD link training

0x109B_208D_004 	
-	increase delta_cal_fail threshold from 4 to 10 (undoes changes 
	implemented in _003)
-	Reset RX verniers at the beginning of calibration. This fixes an issue 
	in which iCals being done after a forced RX PLL recalibration would 
	cause a degraded BER

0x109B_208D_005	
-	Fixed DVOS sign issue which caused BER bursts when HF changes during 
	pCal

0x109B_208D_006	
-	Introduce NRZ max eye size code

0x109B_208D_0A5	
-	lowers delta_cal_fail threshold from 10 to 4 (again)
-	Added NRZ max eye size config parameter
-	Change max LF during iCal bootstrap to 4 when in NRZ mode

0x109B_208D_0A6	
-	When vernier tuning fails, clear the current failed calibration value

0x109B_208D_0A7	
-	When vernier tuning fails, clear ALL vernier calibration values

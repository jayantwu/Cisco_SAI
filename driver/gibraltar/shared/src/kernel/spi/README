This driver is used for enabling only, and is not intended for use in production systems. It is under the GPL license.

In the 16nm test chip, we created a SPI interface. In Pacific, the SPI interface has been replaced
with standard I2C iterface.
Also, in the mezzanine board we have, there was no SPI interface but multiple GPIOs.

Hence, the driver in this directory enables connecting to the 16nm TC SPI connector via GPIOs pins.

We used spi-gpio-custom.c from OpenWRT (see license in the file) and to load it we used
insmod with parameters.
i.e.
insmod spi-gpio-custom.ko bus0=2,0,1,4,0,1000000,2

Creating SPIDEV device /dev/spidev2.0, using GPIO pins 0 (sck), 1 (MOSI), 4 (MISO), 
0 (mode - see below), 1000000 (max 1MHz), 2 (GPIO pin for CS).

SPI modes (from spi.h):
#define SPI_CPHA        0x01                    /* clock phase */
#define SPI_CPOL        0x02                    /* clock polarity */
#define SPI_MODE_0      (0|0)                   /* (original MicroWire) */
#define SPI_MODE_1      (0|SPI_CPHA)
#define SPI_MODE_2      (SPI_CPOL|0)
#define SPI_MODE_3      (SPI_CPOL|SPI_CPHA)
